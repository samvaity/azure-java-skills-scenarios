> **IMPORTANT:**
> - DO NOT look at any files in this repository in the process of following this prompt, except for any skill files located in the `/skills` directory. In particular, do NOT read `validation.md` in this scenario directory.
> - Write all output to the appropriate subfolder of this scenario's directory. If you have Azure SDK skills installed, write to `with-skills/`. If you do not, write to `baseline/`. If you are unsure which applies, ask the user before proceeding.
> - Provide **two complete, separate implementations** — one synchronous and one asynchronous — in separate subdirectories (`sync/` and `async/`) under the output directory. Both implementations should cover the same functionality.

Create a small Java 17 Maven project that implements a feature flag and configuration management system backed by Azure App Configuration.

The project needs:

- A **configuration service class** (both sync and async versions) that retrieves settings from App Configuration. It should support fetching a single setting by key, fetching a setting with a specific label (to distinguish between environments like "production" vs "staging"), and listing all settings that match a key prefix (returned as a map). It should also avoid re-downloading values that haven't changed since the last read — minimize unnecessary network traffic when polling for config changes.

- A **feature flag evaluator class** that reads feature flags from App Configuration. Feature flags in App Configuration use a special key prefix and store their state as a JSON payload. The evaluator should be able to check if a flag is enabled, and also support percentage-based rollout — if a flag is configured for a percentage rollout (e.g., 30% of users), the evaluator should deterministically decide whether a given user ID falls within the rollout percentage using a consistent hash, so the same user always gets the same result.

- A **configuration watcher class** that periodically polls for configuration changes. It should accept a list of "sentinel" keys to watch and a polling interval. When a sentinel key's value changes, the watcher should trigger a full refresh of all cached configuration. This is the recommended pattern for coordinating config updates in App Configuration.

- A **Main class** that demos both implementations: connecting to App Configuration (endpoint from environment variable, authenticated with managed identity), reading some config values with labels, evaluating feature flags for a few sample user IDs with percentage rollout, and starting the config watcher to detect a change. Run the full demo with the sync implementation first, then repeat with the async implementation.

Include a complete `pom.xml` with the necessary Azure SDK dependencies.
